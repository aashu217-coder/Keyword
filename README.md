A Keyword DOM Project in JavaScript typically refers to a web-based project that involves searching, filtering, or highlighting specific keywords within a webpage by manipulating the DOM dynamically. These projects are commonly used for:

1. Search functionality (finding words in a document)
2. Text highlighting (marking keywords in a webpage)
3. Content filtering (showing/hiding elements based on keywords)
4. Tagging systems (extracting and managing keywords from text)

ðŸ“ŒCommon Features of a Keyword DOM Project
 1. Keyword Search
 2. Users can input a keyword, and the script searches for it in the page.
    Example: Pressing "Enter" highlights all matching words.

 3. Dynamic Highlighting
    Uses span elements with CSS styling (e.g., yellow background) to mark keywords.
    Example: document.querySelectorAll() to find text nodes and wrap matches.

 4. Case-Insensitive Matching
